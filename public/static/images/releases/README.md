# Release Images

This directory contains images for the release notes carousel on the login page.

In a production environment, these would be actual screenshots or illustrations of new features. For the demo, we're using placeholder references.

The application will look for images at paths like:
- `/static/images/releases/ptl-tracking.png`
- `/static/images/releases/dashboard-analytics.png`
- `/static/images/releases/dock-occupancy.png`
