# Avatar Images

This directory contains avatar images for user profiles.

In a production environment, these would be actual user profile pictures. For the demo, we're using placeholder references.

The application will look for images at paths like:
- `/static/images/avatar/1.jpg`
- `/static/images/avatar/2.jpg`
- `/static/images/avatar/3.jpg`
