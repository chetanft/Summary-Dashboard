# Order Timeline Component Prompt for Cursor AI

## Component Overview

This is a timeline component that visually represents the lifecycle of an order in a Transportation Management System (TMS). The timeline is displayed in the "Invoice Details" view of the Summary Dashboard. Each major stage of the order (e.g., SO Generated, Planning, Indent, Tracking, ePOD, etc.) is represented chronologically.

### Key Features:
- Each stage is collapsible via a chevron icon.
- Timestamps and durations are shown for each sub-stage.
- Sub-stages include specific actions and metadata (e.g., Weight, Vehicle Number, Status Updates).
- Each stage includes dynamic content based on order processing progress.

## Interaction Details

- **Expand/Collapse**: Clicking the chevron toggles visibility of the sub-steps within a stage.
- **Time Display**: Shows start time, end time, and duration per step (if available).
- **Statuses**: Represented with icons or tags (e.g., "In Process", "Pending Acceptance").
