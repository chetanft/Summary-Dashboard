# üì¶ Freight & Logistics Dashboard KPIs (.md Spec)

This document outlines the full KPI structure and layout for operations dashboard page which is present in the toggle tabs for all user personas. remove current KPIs and these KPIs. Don't change the functionality, just update the KPIs only. remeber this updating doesn't get issues with netlify deployment.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Layout Strategy

- Use a **3-column layout**
- Group by: `Planning`, `Pre Dispatch`, `In Transit`, `Post Delivery`
- Each section uses unique chart types (limit: no more than 2 of same chart type)
- Prioritize **donuts for statuses**, **bars for time/volume**, **tiles for totals**, and **trendlines only if needed**

## üß≠ Final KPI Layout Summary

- **Donut Chart** (Max: 6 uses): Order Assignment, Indent, Accepted Split, Trip Delivery, ePOD Submitted, ePOD Approval
- **Bar Chart** (Max: 6 uses): Assignment Pending, Reporting Pending, Loading TAT, Rejection Reasons, Raised/Overcharged
- **Stat Tile**: Used freely for count, amount, or percentage
- **Line Chart**: Only for Planning trends

---

## üí° Dashboard UX Guidelines

- Use **section headers** as sticky tabs: Planning | Pre Dispatch | In Transit | Post Delivery
- Stat Tiles should show **amount + (count)** when relevant (e.g. ‚Çπ509 Cr (180))
- Use **alerts (red)** for SLA breach, pending approvals, over speeding
- Disable repeated donut/bar types across same section

## üöõ FTL vs PTL Tabs

Add tabs within each section to toggle between FTL and PTL KPIs.
